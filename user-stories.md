# User Stories

## MVP
* As a user, I want to see an even numbered grid of blank cards that flip over when I click on them so I can see what the image on the other side is.
* As a user, when I click on two cards that have the same image, those two cards should stay flipped so that I don't click on them again.
* As a user, when all the cards have been matched the game should end so that I don't play forever.
* As a developer, when a user clicks on a card I want the card to flip so that the user has a pleasurable experience playing the game.
* As a developer, I want to utilize the class syntax in JavaScript so that I gain a better understanding of their use.
* As a developer, I want to incorporate switch statements whenever appropriate so taht I gain a better understanding of their use.

## Stretch Goals
* As a user, when the game first starts all the cards should show their image for 5-10 seconds so I have a chance to start memorizing where each image is.
* As a user, when a match is made I want the two cards to fly away so that they do not clutter the screen.
* As a user, I want to have a hard mode where I am only allowed to get 5 wrong guesses before the game ends so that I can challenge my brain.
* As a user, I want matched cards to joust each other and esplode on contact (super stretch).
